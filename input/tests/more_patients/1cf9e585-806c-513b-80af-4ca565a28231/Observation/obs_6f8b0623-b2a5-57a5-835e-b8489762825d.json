INTERPRETATION:  INFECTION AT UNDETERMINED TIME.  A positive IgG result generally indicates past exposure.  Infection with CMV once contracted remains latent and may reactivate when immunity is compromised.  Greatly elevated serum protein with IgG levels >2000 mg/dl may cause  interference with CMV IgM results.  If current infection is suspected, submit follow-up serum in 2-3 weeks.
