/*
Patients 65 and older with type 2 diabetes whose diabetes started at least 90 days 
before the start of the measurement period (MP) who are on an antihyperglycemic 
medication other than metformin monotherapy and who have complex clinical status* 
or risks for hypoglycemia with a visit during the MP

*Complex clinical status includes having at least one of the conditions listed below:

****       Taking at least two antihyperglycemics including insulin or sulfonylureas in MP
·          Blindness in MP
·          Diabetic peripheral neuropathy in MP,
·          History of amputation of lower extremity
·          History of coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary intervention, myocardial infarction, or stroke
·          Ischemic vascular disease in MP
****       At least three chronic conditions in MP: chronic heart failure, chronic kidney disease, dementia without complications, arthritis, cancer, depression, falls, hypertension
·          Oxygen dependent lung disease in MP
·          Chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis, or end state renal disease in MP
·          Hospice care in MP
·          Dementia and/or cognitive impairment with complications in MP
·          History of hypoglycemia requiring treatment
·          Last A1c >8.6% in year prior to MP
·          Last A1c >9.1% in year prior to MP
·          BMI < 26 in MP
·          Identified with macroalbuminuria (albumin to creatinine ratio > 300) in MP
·          Last serum creatinine concentration > 114.9 uMol/l in MP

2. At least 3 chronic conditions in MP.  I think the diagnosis will be overlaps, so:
  a. Diagnosis: Chronic heart failure overlaps MP
  b. Diagnosis: Chronic kidney disease overlaps MP
  c. Diagnosis: Dementia without complications overlaps MP
  d. Diagnosis: Arthritis overlaps MP
  e. Diagnosis: Cancer overlaps MP
  f. Diagnosis: Hypertension overlaps MP
* g. Diagnosis: Depression – there could be multiple episodes, but we want at least one episode in the MP.  If the person has 2 episodes, we only want to count them once toward the total of 3.
* h. Assessment Result (maybe), maybe diagnosis: Falls – there could be multiple falls, but we want at least one fall in the MP (we are toying with the MP and the year prior).  If the person has multiple falls, we only want to count this once toward the total of 3.
